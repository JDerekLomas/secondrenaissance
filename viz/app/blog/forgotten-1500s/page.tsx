        The sixteenth century was the age of Copernicus, Vesalius, and the Scientific Revolution.
        It was also the century when hundreds of natural philosophers wrote in Latin—works that
        remain untranslated today.
      </p>

      <h2>The Century of Transformation</h2>

      <p>
        Between 1500 and 1600, the European worldview was revolutionized. Copernicus displaced
        Earth from the center of the cosmos. Vesalius transformed anatomy through direct
        observation. Paracelsus challenged Galenic medicine. The &ldquo;New World&rdquo; expanded
        geographical and botanical knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        We know these famous names. But behind each revolutionary figure stood networks of
        correspondents, critics, students, and rivals—all writing in Latin. Their works document
        how new ideas were debated, refined, and spread. Almost none have been translated.

      <h2>Key Figures in Detail</h2>

      <h3 style={{ color: '#9e4a3a' }}>Jacopo Zabarella (1533-1589)</h3>
      <p>
        The most important philosopher of science before Galileo. His <em>De methodis</em> and
        <em> De regressu</em> developed the demonstrative method that Galileo would later use.
        Zabarella&apos;s analysis of how we move from effects to causes and back to effects
        (the &ldquo;regressus&rdquo;) was foundational for experimental science. His logical works
        went through dozens of editions. Only fragments have been translated into English.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ color: '#9e4a3a' }}>Girolamo Cardano (1501-1576)</h3>
      <p>
        Polymath, physician, mathematician, astrologer. His <em>De subtilitate</em> (1550) and
        <em> De rerum varietate</em> (1557) were encyclopedias of natural philosophy that influenced
        Bacon and Leibniz. He solved the cubic equation. He wrote an autobiography (<em>De vita
        propria</em>) that pioneered the genre. His medical works shaped practice for a century.
        Most remains untranslated.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ color: '#9e4a3a' }}>Giambattista della Porta (1535-1615)</h3>
      <p>
        His <em>Magia Naturalis</em> (1558, expanded 1589) was a bestselling compendium of
        natural wonders, experiments, and secrets of nature. It covered optics (he may have
        invented the telescope before Galileo), cryptography, alchemy, and what we&apos;d now call
        chemistry. 156 editions in the USTC. An early English translation (1658) is archaic
        and incomplete; no modern scholarly translation exists.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ color: '#9e4a3a' }}>Bernardino Telesio (1509-1588)</h3>
      <p>
        His <em>De rerum natura iuxta propria principia</em> (1565) proposed a radical
        alternative to Aristotelian physics based on heat, cold, and matter. Bacon called
        him &ldquo;the first of the moderns.&rdquo; His influence on Campanella, Bruno, and early
        modern science was immense. The Latin text has never been fully translated into English.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ color: '#9e4a3a' }}>Jean Fernel (1497-1558)</h3>
      <p>
        Court physician to Henri II of France and founder of modern physiology (he coined
        the term). His <em>Universa Medicina</em> (1567) was the standard medical textbook
        for over a century. His <em>De abditis rerum causis</em> explored the hidden causes
        of disease. Crucial for understanding pre-Harvey medicine. No complete English translation.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ color: '#9e4a3a' }}>Ulisse Aldrovandi (1522-1605)</h3>
      <p>
        The father of natural history. His encyclopedic works on animals, plants, and minerals
        ran to 13 folio volumes (and more published posthumously). He created one of Europe&apos;s
        first natural history museums. His works shaped how nature was classified for two
        centuries. Almost entirely untranslated.
      </p>

      <h2>The Scientific Revolution&apos;s Hidden Foundations</h2>

      <p>
        The standard story of the Scientific Revolution jumps from Copernicus (1543) to Galileo
        (1610) to Newton (1687). But in between, hundreds of natural philosophers worked out
        problems of method, evidence, and explanation. They debated:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>What counts as demonstration?</strong> — Zabarella, Nifo, and the Paduan
        school refined Aristotelian logic for scientific use</li>
        <li><strong>What is matter?</strong> — Telesio, Patrizi, and others proposed
        alternatives to Aristotle&apos;s hylomorphism</li>
        <li><strong>How do we classify nature?</strong> — Cesalpino, Aldrovandi, and Gessner
        developed new systems of natural history</li>
        <li><strong>What causes disease?</strong> — Fracastoro&apos;s germ theory, Fernel&apos;s
        physiology, Cardano&apos;s case studies</li>
        <li><strong>How do occult qualities work?</strong> — Della Porta, Cardano, and others
        investigated magnetism, sympathies, and natural magic</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Galileo and Descartes didn&apos;t emerge from a vacuum. They read these authors, responded
        to their arguments, and built on their methods. Without access to this literature,
        we misunderstand the Scientific Revolution.
      </p>

      <h2>The Problem of &ldquo;Minor&rdquo; Figures</h2>

      <p>
        Many of these authors are called &ldquo;minor figures&rdquo;—but only because we can&apos;t read
        them. Zabarella was read across Europe for a century. Della Porta&apos;s <em>Magia Naturalis</em>
        went through more editions than most works we consider canonical. Fernel was the
        most cited medical authority of his age.
      </p>

      <p>
        The designation &ldquo;minor&rdquo; often means &ldquo;untranslated.&rdquo; If we could read these authors
        as easily as we read Bacon or Descartes, our understanding of early modern thought
        would be transformed.
      </p>

      <h2>The Opportunity</h2>

      <p>
        Unlike medieval manuscripts, most sixteenth-century Latin texts are printed and
        increasingly digitized. The barrier isn&apos;t access to the books—it&apos;s access to the language.
      </p>

      <p>
        A systematic translation effort, aided by modern AI tools, could open this literature
        within years rather than decades. Historians of science, philosophers, and curious
        readers could finally engage with the full conversation of the Renaissance.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Cinquecento is not a gap between medieval and modern. It&apos;s the crucible where
        modern thought was forged—in Latin, by authors we&apos;ve forgotten, in texts we&apos;ve
        never translated.
      </p>

      <p>
        It&apos;s time to remember.
